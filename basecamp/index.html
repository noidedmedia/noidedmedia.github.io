    <p>We've been working together for nearly two years, and our skills compliment each other particularly well. We don't necessarily want or need to work on the same project, but we wanted to apply to an internship together. You never leave your friends behind, especially when you've gotten this far together.
    <p>Anthony is a programmer, taking care of software design, databases, and deployment. Connor is a web designer and developer, taking care of overall design and implementing many of the user-facing parts of our websites. <!-- Together, we founded Noided Media to -->
    <p>We're both big fans of Basecamp's philosophy as a company, and would love the opportunity to learn from some great people.

    <h2>We've worked together on a few projects</h2>
    
    <a href="https://www.imagehex.com/">
      {% include image.html url="/images/basecamp/ImageHex.png" %}
    </a>

    <p><a href="https://www.imagehex.com/">ImageHex</a> is an art website – still in development – with the goal of making commissioning art online an easier, more enjoyable process for both artists and clients. It's built with Rails, and has been a huge undertaking, with more than 1800 commits in our GitHub repository.

    <p><b>Anthony</b>: ImageHex has been a great learning experience, as well as a great challenge. When I started it, I'd never done any website of even half its size or complexity. This, of course, resulted in an unmaintainable initial version which we threw out. The latest version is <i>much</i> better, and makes better use of Rails as a framework. It also served as an opportunity for me to learn SQL, so we could do all of our complex queries in the DB itself as opposed to in a <code>.map</code>. While I mainly do backend work, I wrote a healthy amount of React.js for this project, to improve the user experience in different areas. 

    <p><b>Connor</b>: ImageHex has been a labour of love over the past year and a half. We've gone to great lengths to make the site both look good and work well. The site is still very rough around the edges, but it's fast, functional, and I think it's been a huge accomplishment for two 18-year-olds working in their spare time. I started from scratch, with no prior web development experience. Over the length of the project I've learned HTML, CSS/SCSS, Git, JavaScript, jQuery, React.js, and Rails, all with a healthy dose of Google and some trial-and-error.

    <a href="http://www.noided.media/WavHead/">
      {% include image.html url="/images/basecamp/WavHead.png" %}
    </a>

    <p><a href="http://www.noided.media/WavHead/">WavHead</a> is a locally-hosted "jukebox" for parties. Built with Sinatra, it was made to be used at LAN parties we had with our group of friends so anyone connected to the network could vote on what music was being played over a connected sound system. It was built and released in late 2014, and its source code <a href="https://github.com/noidedmedia/WavHead">is available on GitHub</a>.

    <p><b>Anthony</b>: WavHead was the first project I ever released, and it was an eye-opening experience. Looking back on it, I definitely made pretty large mistakes &mdash; chief among them the fact that invalid URL characters in album, artist, or track names breaking the app, closely followed by the app randomly continuing to play songs after quitting &mdash; but I'm still pretty proud of the final product.

    <p><b>Connor</b>: Working on a project like WavHead was a huge learning experience for me. There were a lot of constraints we had to think about, since it had to be hosted locally, and therefore lightweight. Most people at parties would probably be interacting with it on their phone, so I learned responsive design. We had minimal bells-and-whistles, we didn't even use a CSS pre-processor. And yeah, the promotional site has scroll-jacking. I'm sorry! I've since gotten a lot better at web design, and I'd really like to go back and fix that some time.

    <a href="http://www.fictiondock.com/">
      {% include image.html url="/images/basecamp/Fiction-Dock.png" %}
    </a>

    <p><a href="http://www.fictiondock.com/">Fiction Dock</a> is "a better place for fan fiction". We built it over the summer last year, and it's also <a href="https://github.com/noidedmedia/Fiction-Dock/">available on GitHub</a>. Unfortunately, Fiction Dock never gained proper traction as we went on to focus more on ImageHex and other commitments.

    <p><b>Anthony</b>: I'm going to be honest. A part of me hates Fiction Dock. We started it after a friend joked that we could probably write a better fanfiction website than the alternatives in a day, a challenge I couldn't resist. Writing it was fun at first, but devolved into a frustrating experience as that one day turned into several weeks and I increasingly ran into things I had no idea how to do. On the plus side, however, figuring out how to handle those problems correctly (after solving them with horrible hacks, some of which are probably still in the codebase) taught me more than almost any other project. While we did drop it in the end, I think the learning experience was worth it.

    <p><b>Connor</b>: We took a break from working on ImageHex to get more practice developing a Rails app from scratch, and the result was Fiction Dock. We learned the value of React.js for complex web interfaces, but we also used it sparingly. We only used React on pages that really needed that deep level of interaction.

    <h2>Sometimes we even work separately!</h2>
    <h3>Anthony</h3>
    <p>I'm a backend developer who has a passion for well-designed, beautiful, and (when necessary) fast code. I founded, taught, and ran the programming club at my high school, and I've done a lot of open source work.</p>

    <p>I'm the creator and primary maintainer of three ruby gems: <a href="https://github.com/AnthonySuper/fatboy">Fatboy,</a> a view count manager, <a href="https://github.com/AnthonySuper/Doublesing">Doublesing,</a> a TeX-like markup language, and <a href="https://github.com/AnthonySuper/train_track">train_track</a>, a version tracker for Rails.</p>

    <p>I've also contributed heavily to the <a href="https://github.com/droptheplot/apipony">Apipony</a> gem, making it better suit ImageHex's needs.
    
    <h3>Connor</h3>
    <p>I'm a web designer and developer with a bit of a neurotic attention to detail. I frequently have to pull myself away from obsessing over minute details so that I can actually ship something out. That said, I definitely think I've gotten better about moderating myself and "putting on the shipping goggles" over the past year.

    <p>Outside of my work at Noided Media, I've built and shipped a redesign of <a href="http://pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Home">PCGamingWiki</a>, where I serve as the lead web developer/designer. We released a <a href="http://community.pcgamingwiki.com/page/blog/_/announcements/new-skin-pcgamingwiki-overclocked-r185">blog post detailing the exact improvements</a>, most notably page speed for a given wiki article going from "76 requests, 443 KB of content, and a load time of 4.47 seconds down to 26 requests, 370 KB of content, and a load time of 2.60 seconds." To my knowledge, it's the first truly responsive MediaWiki skin that's been released as open source, something I'm particularly proud of.

    <p>I've also done freelance work, designing the logo and building <a href="https://fna-xna.github.io/">the site for indie game engine FNA</a> using Jekyll. The creator of FNA <a href="https://plus.google.com/+flibitijibibo/posts/ZzEYaV4EAxV">was pretty happy with it</a>. Before learning web development, I did software mockups – such as my <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/18931105/Steam-Redesign-Concept">Steam Redesign Mockup</a> – as well as more traditional graphic design, samples of which you can find on <a href="https://www.imagehex.com/@connor">my ImageHex profile</a>.

    <h2>Why we're applying and what we hope to offer</h2>
    
    <h3>Anthony</h3>
    <p>I'm only a freshman in college, but I have been programming for a few years.
    I enjoy many of the things you guys build.
    Heck, I work so much with Rails I'm sure DHH owns at least 5% of my soul.
    When I saw that you had an internship opportunity, I knew I had to apply.

    <p><b>Decisiveness</b>
    <p>You want a team of "managers of one."
    I'm the owner of half of a two-person startup.
    In such a small company, both of us have to call the shots for our own responsibilities.
    While we at Noided Media have been managing fairly well, I want to be able to grow further.
    I'll be honest: my cofounder and I have had some communication issues.
    There have been times where both of us have conflicting ideas of what needs to be done, and our productivity has suffered as a result.
    The opportunity to work with a mentor will be invaluable to me, as it will provide me with the insight I need to retain my independent action while improving my ability to work with others.

    <p><b>Scale</b>
    <p>My company is still in the early stages.
    We have users that we consult with on features, but we don't have many of them.
    Basecamp, on the other hand, has hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users.
    Trying to find the needs of our users has been an extremely interesting challenge, even with our small scale.
    I can't imagine how complex it is when you have a user base as big as Basecamp's &mdash; or how rewarding it feels when you get the feature just right.
    The opportunity to intern with Basecamp will let me learn to interact with users at scale, giving me the knowledge I need to succeed in my own company.

    <p><b>Philosophy</b>
    <p>I've always admired the type of company Basecamp is.
    One of your cofounders, DHH, has <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857">discussed this</a> on Medium.
    You make great products that provide a useful service.
    In a world where I've had people tell me to scrap my ideas because they could only make millions instead of billions, we need more of that.
    <p>
    This philosophy (as well as the reputation of your products) means that I can trust that your company will focus on what actually matters, as opposed to desperately sprinting towards some arbitrary funding goal.
    <p><b>Projects I'm Interested In</b></p>
    <p>I'm also applying in part because of the available projects to work on.
      Several caught my eye.
      <ul>
        <li>As a supporter of Open Source, Trix would be a dream to work on. I've wanted a web-based rich text editor many times in my projects, and have never quite found one that fits. Trix already looks great, and I've love to be able to make it better.</li>
        <li>While working on ImageHex and FictionDock, I implemented some fairly complex search systems. It would be a rewarding experience to apply this knowledge to your internal search tools, in order to make a better experience for your clients and support staff.</li>
        <li>I've always found data analysis fascinating. The chance to improve your analysis of internal tools to find unusual values sounds extremely interesting, and will no doubt be a rewarding experience.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Connor</h3>
    <p>I'm applying for an internship for two main reasons: I love making users happy and I love companies that are committed to making things <i>better</i>. Basecamp is well-known for making users happy and for being good stewards to the community with open source projects like Rails.

    <p>There are a few projects I'm interested in working on at Basecamp:

    <ul>
      <li>I'm hoping to offer my experience in web development with Rails to Basecamp's support team. I'd like to help them find pain points in their support workflow, and solve those problems with software. Better tooling and a better workflow means better response times, happier users, and happier support staff!
      <li>I'd also be interested in design research: analyzing how Basecamp users interact with clients through the product, collecting data to understand their problems, and figuring out how we can best improve Basecamp to fit with their goals.
      <li>I'd also be more than happy to lend some design help to other interns working on their respective projects, if that's of any interest.
    </ul>

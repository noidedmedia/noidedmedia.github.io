    <h1>Anthony Super</h1>
    <p>Hello. I am Anthony Super.<sup><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>
    You probably guessed that from the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with the words "Anthony Super" in it.
    <p>I'm only a freshman in college, but I have been programming for a few years.
    I enjoy many of the things you guys build.
    Heck, I work so much with Rails I'm sure DHH owns at least 5% of my soul.
    When I saw that you had an internship opportunity, I knew I had to apply.
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Why I'm Applying</h2>
    <p>I wouldn't be applying to this internship if I didn't think it would be beneficial for both of us.
    Your company philosophy and my personality mesh together very well.
    I think that this internship will not only let me help you, but also let me grow as a programmer and a person.
    <section>
      <h3>Decisiveness</h3>
      <p>You want a team of "managers of one."
      I'm the owner of half of a two-person startup.
      In such a small company, both of us have to call the shots for our own responsibilities.
      While we at Noided Media have been managing fairly well, I want to be able to grow further.
      I'll be honest: my cofounder and I have had some communication issues.
      There have been times where both of us have conflicting ideas of what needs to be done, and our productivity has suffered as a result.
      The opportunity to work with a mentor will be invaluable to me, as it will provide me with the insight I need to retain my independent action while improving my ability to work with others.
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Scale</h3>
      <p>My company is still in the early stages.
      We have users that we consult with on features, but we don't have many of them.
      Basecamp, on the other hand, has hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of users.
      Trying to find the needs of our users has been an extremely interesting challenge, even with our small scale.
      I can't imagine how complex it is when you have a user base as big as Basecamp's&mdash;or how rewarding it feels when you get the feature just right.
      The opportunity to intern with Basecamp will let me learn to interact with users at scale, giving me the knowledge I need to succeed in my own company.
    </section>  
    <section>
      <h3>Philosophy</h3>
      I've always admired the type of company Basecamp is.
      Your employee DHH has <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/reconsider-41adf356857">discussed this</a> on Medium.
      You make great products that provide a useful service.
      In a world where I've had people tell me to scrap my ideas because they could only make millions instead of billions, we need more of that.
      <p>
      This philosophy (as well as the reputation of your products) means that I can trust that your company will focus on what actually matters, as opposed to desperately sprinting towards some arbitrary funding goal.

    <h2>What I Offer</h2>
    Of course, I wouldn't be applying to this internship unless I could do something for you guys as well.

    <h3>Footnotes</h3>
    <ol id="footnote-list">
      <li id="fn-1">Yes, that is my real name. It's not particularly special, but sometimes people (mostly while reserving a table) look at me like they think I'm lying when I tell them it. I don't know why&mdash;if I was going to make up a fake name, it would be something like "Metalcrusher" or "Starkiller."

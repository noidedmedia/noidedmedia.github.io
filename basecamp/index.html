    <h1>Anthony Super</h1>
    Hello. I am Anthony Super.<sup><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>
    You probably guessed that from the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> with the words "Anthony Super" in it.
    <br>
    <br>
    I'm only a freshman in college, but I have been programming for a few years.

    I enjoy many of the things you guys build.
    Heck, I work so much with Rails I'm sure DHH owns at least 5% of my soul.

  </ol>
